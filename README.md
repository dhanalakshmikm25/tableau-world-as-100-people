It highlights how male–female literacy and education levels differ globally across **primary, secondary, and tertiary** education.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Men and women represent equal shares globally (50 % each).  
- Literacy is high overall, but **fewer girls progress beyond secondary school**.  
- **Male participation** dominates at college/university level.  
- Gender gaps persist across regions despite near-equal global population shares.

## 🗺️ Dashboard Components
1. **Gender Distribution Pie Chart** – World’s gender ratio (50 : 50).  
2. **Bar Charts** – Education attainment by gender and level.  
3. **Stacked Bar Chart** – Overall literacy comparison (male vs female).  
4. **Narrative Section** – Summary text emphasizing disparities in education pathways.
